			We are happy people and we love to smile. Yes, we smile a lot. In distressing times, we are there to help each other and build up. We won’t leave you when you are with us.<br><br>
			We love our environment. We love our place. And we have good spots to tour you when you visit us. You will surely enjoy your stay with us.<br><br>
			Lastly, we believe in God. We are comprised of different beliefs but we prefer to be united in order to safeguard peace and togetherness.
